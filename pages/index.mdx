## Core Objects

### Action

An action is a modification made by AI to your source code. It serves as the "orchestrator" and allows you to specify which files need to be updated.

For API and examples, see [Action](/API/action)

### Rule

A rule is a template prompt used to instruct AI to make changes to a portion of your code.
You can inject variables into rules, which will be used when applying them.

Rules can be referenced by actions like described on the action example above.

For API and examples, see [Rule](/API/rule)
