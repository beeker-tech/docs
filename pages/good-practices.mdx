# Good practices

## Repository Files

To ensure your repository remains efficient and manageable, adhere to the following guidelines:

**Maintain Minimal File Sizes:** By keeping files compact, you not only streamline your codebase but also enhance its readability.

**Monitor Code Length:** Aim to limit the length of your files. When files exceed 300 to 400 lines, you may notice a drop in performance.

**Consider AI Analysis:** Remember that artificial intelligence systems must parse through the entire contents of your files before executing any operations. Concise files facilitate faster processing.

Following these practices will contribute significantly to a well-organized and high-performing code repository.

## Context

Context files play a crucial role in guiding AI on how it should perform its tasks.

Nevertheless, it's important to note that an increase in context provided to the AI can result in additional processing overhead.

Typically, utilizing a single context file is the standard practice. To maintain optimal performance, it is advisable to limit the number of context files to no more than three.
